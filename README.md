# The_Naive_Baker
The Naive Baker is a project to let you explore new recipes with ingredients you already have at hand. Enter your pantry quickly using autocomplete and machine generated ingredient suggestions, then find out what you can cook! Use the filters to limit the amount of time you have, or to select the particular ingredients you feel like cooking with today. We use Agile process model here, specifically SCRUM.
